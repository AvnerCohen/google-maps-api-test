====================
![Travis-CI status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/AvnerCohen/google-maps-api-test.png)

A test code to play with the google maps api on the client side.

Used with an node js express only to serve the file locally.
In chrome, it's not possible to get '''navigator.geolocation''' to work otherwise.

Also used to test travis CI integration.
